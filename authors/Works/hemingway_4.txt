it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose 
and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes. 
Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again. 
“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no 
scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, 
turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after 
he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in 
all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were 
circling it and driving it. 
If they don’t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched 
the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait 
fish that were forced to the surface in their panic. 
“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under 
his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight 
of the small tuna’s shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. 
The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the 
water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring 
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering 
strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness 
and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern. 
“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh ten pounds.” 
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. 
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes 
when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had 
probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not 
remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was 
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was 
considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always 
considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since 
there was no one that they could annoy. 
“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy,” he said 
aloud. “But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in 
their boats and to bring them the baseball.” 
Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only 
one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he 
thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are 
working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and 
to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not 
know? 
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that 
showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high 
snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the 
water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was 
only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines 
going straight down into the water that was a mile deep. 
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished 
among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for 
baits, were down again. The sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of 
his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed. 
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake 
me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well. 
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply. 
“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out 
for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt 
no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a 
tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred 
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna. 
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from 
the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension. 
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. 
Please eat them. 
How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the 
dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. He felt the light 
delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more 
difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing. 
“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren’t they 
lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be 
shy, fish. Eat them.” 
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other 
lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same 
delicate pulling touch again. 
“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take it.” 
He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing. 
“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s making a turn. 
Maybe he 
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it. 
Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy. 
“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.” 
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and 
unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, 
down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly 
through the old man’s fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of 
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. “What a fish,” he said. “He has it 
sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it.” 
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew 
that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and 
he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his 
mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the 
weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and 
finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down. 
“He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.” 
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and 
made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the 
next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using. 
“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.” 
Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. 
Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you 
been long enough at table? 
“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and 
then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the 
strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body. 
Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise 
him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack 
until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a 
slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the 
thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the 
north-west. 
The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits 
were still in the water but there was nothing to be done. 
“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a fish and I’m the 
towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I 
can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going 
down.” 
What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do if he sounds and 
dies I don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are plenty of things I can do. 
He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff 
moving steadily to the north-west. 
This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But four hours later 
the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still 
braced solidly with the line across his back. 
“It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen him.” 
He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it 
was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being 
careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the 
water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the 
bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to 
endure. 
Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no 
difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two 
more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t 
maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with 
the sunrise. I have no
